## How I Became a Developer

I have over a decade of experience in the medical field, where I was a dedicated healthcare professional. However, the COVID-19 pandemic took a toll on me and I felt burnt out. That's when I made the transition into software development. It was my passion for problem-solving and desire to make a positive impact in the world has led me to pursue a career in technology. I am always open to new opportunities and excited to see what the future holds!
